## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass (Scss) 
- CSS custom properties (Variable)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts Integration
- Responsive Website
- Accessibility features
- Box model & borders
- CSS hover effects
- CSS Reset Techniques

### What I learned

Iâ€™ve learned how to effectively combine HTML5, Sass, and modern CSS techniques to create a responsive and visually appealing blog preview card. I deepened my understanding of using semantic HTML for better structure and accessibility, while also refining my skills in responsive design with a mobile-first approach. Using SCSS, I streamlined my styling process by leveraging variables, mixins, and nesting, which made my code more efficient and reusable. Additionally, working with Flexbox improved my ability to align and structure elements flexibly, and I gained more confidence in applying hover effects and media queries for a polished user experience. Overall, this challenge reinforced my ability to create scalable, maintainable front-end projects.

### Continued development

I realize there's always room for improvement and learning. I could focus on enhancing my use of accessibility features, such as improving ARIA labels and ensuring my design is fully keyboard-navigable. Another area for growth is optimizing performance by reducing image sizes and using more efficient asset loading techniques. Exploring CSS Grid could help me create even more complex layouts in future projects. Additionally, diving deeper into JavaScript would allow me to add dynamic functionality to the components, making my designs more interactive and responsive to user actions. Expanding my knowledge in these areas will allow me to build even more advanced, user-friendly applications.
